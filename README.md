Clean text file and analyse professor courses


a file class.txt that shows the courses taught by  professors.
However, since data is not clean, there might be cases that multiple versions of professor/course
names actually refer to the same professor/course. my task is to clean the dataset using proper
transformation rules, and analyze the cleaned dataset
